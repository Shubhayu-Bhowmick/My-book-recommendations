    <h2>About the book</h2>
    <p>In Sapiens, Yuval posits an interesting theory that this discrepancy between our societal reality 
        (a globalized world) and slower rate of biological evolution, might make it harder for us to get along with different 
        species or even different people from within our own species, leading to clashes.</p>
    <p>I think it is definitely worth reading, although this is is not a life-changing book, in the sense you won't become 
        enlightened or change the direction of your life.</p>
