    <h2>About the book</h2>
   <p>To Kill a Mockingbird is both a young girl's coming-of-age story and a darker drama 
    about the roots and consequences of racism and prejudice, probing 
    how good and evil can coexist within a single community or individual.</p>
   <p>In this story of innocence destroyed by evil, the 'mockingbird' comes to
     represent the idea of innocence. Thus, to kill a mockingbird is to destroy innocence." 
     The longest quotation about the book's title appears in Chapter 10,
     when Scout explains: "'Remember it's a sin to kill a mockingbird.</p>
