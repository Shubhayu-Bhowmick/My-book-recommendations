    <h2>About the book</h2>
    <p>When Breath Becomes Air follows Kalanithi's journey from medical student, deciding what would provide a 
        meaningful life, to neurosurgeon, who operates in the very centre of the human identity: 
        the brain, before finally a patient with terminal cancer, as a new father.</p>
    <p>Book Summary. Breath is an extraordinary evocation of an adolescence spent resisting complacency, 
        testing one's limits against nature, finding like-minded souls, and discovering just how far one breath
         will take you. It's a story of extremesâ€”extreme sports and extreme emotions.</p>
