    <h2>About the book</h2>
    <p>A Brief History of Time: From the Big Bang to Black Holes is a book on theoretical cosmology by 
        English physicist Stephen Hawking. It was first published in 1988. 
        Hawking wrote the book for readers who had no prior knowledge of physics.</p>
        <p>Hawking does a great job in covering complex ideas in a way that laypeople can understand and 
            even injects a bit of humor into the work as well.</p>
